1. How many Service Accounts exist in the default namespace?
    - kubectl get serviceaccounts 입력


2. What is the secret token used by the default service account?
    - kubectl describe sa default 입력


3. We just deployed the Dashboard application. Inspect the deployment. What is the image used by the deployment?
    - kubectl describe deployment 입력


4. Wait for the deployment to be ready. Access the custom-dashboard by clicking on the link to dashboard portal.



5. What is the state of the dashboard? Have the pod details loaded successfully?



6. What type of account does the Dashboard application use to query the Kubernetes API?
    - 주어진 웹 페이지 팝업에서 확인 가능
    - service account


7. Which account does the Dashboard application use to query the Kubernetes API?
    - 주어진 웹 페이지 팝업에서 확인 가능
    - default


8. Inspect the Dashboard Application POD and identify the Service Account mounted on it.
    - kubectl get pod -o yaml | grep cc 로 확인



9. At what location is the ServiceAccount credentials available within the pod?
    - kubectl get pod -o yaml | grep cc 로 확인


10. The application needs a ServiceAccount with the Right permissions to be created to authenticate to Kubernetes. The default ServiceAccount has limited access. Create a new ServiceAccount named dashboard-sa.
    - kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard-sa 실행



11. We just added additional permissions for the newly created dashboard-sa account using RBAC.<br>
If you are interested checkout the files used to configure RBAC at /var/rbac. We will discuss RBAC in a separate section.

12. Enter the access token in the UI of the dashboard application. Click Load Dashboard button to load Dashboard<br>
Create an authorization token for the newly created service account, copy the generated token and paste it into the token field of the UI.<br>
To do this, run kubectl create token dashboard-sa for the dashboard-sa service account, copy the token and paste it in the UI.
    - 


13. You shouldn't have to copy and paste the token each time. The Dashboard application is programmed to read token from the secret mount location. However currently, the default service account is mounted. Update the deployment to use the newly created ServiceAccount<br>
Edit the deployment to change ServiceAccount from default to dashboard-sa.
    - kubectl set sa deploy/web-dashboard dashboard-sa 입력


14. Refresh the Dashboard application UI and you should now see the PODs listed automatically.<br>
This time you shouldn't have to put in the token manually.
