1. How many Labels exist on node node01?
```
kubectl describe node node01 
```
2. What is the value set to the label key beta.kubernetes.io/arch on node01?
```
kubectl describe node node01 
```
3. 
4. Create a new deployment named blue with the nginx image and 3 replicas.
```
kubectl create deploy blue --image=nginx --replicas=3
```
5. Which nodes can the pods for the blue deployment be placed on?
Make sure to check taints on both nodes!
```
kubectl get pod -o wide
```
6. Set Node Affinity to the deployment to place the pods on node01 only.
```
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: blue
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: color
                operator: In
                values:
                - blue
```
7. Which nodes are the pods placed on now?
```
kubectl get node -o wide
```
8. Create a new deployment named red with the nginx image and 2 replicas, and ensure it gets placed on the controlplane node only.
Use the label key - node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane - which is already set on the controlplane node.
```

      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
                operator: Exists
```
