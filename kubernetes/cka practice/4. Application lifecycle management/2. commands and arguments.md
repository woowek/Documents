3. Create a pod with the ubuntu image to run a container to sleep for 5000 seconds. Modify the file ubuntu-sleeper-2.yaml.
    Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name.
    ```
    apiVersion: v1 
    kind: Pod 
    metadata:
    name: ubuntu-sleeper-2 
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu
        command:
        - "sleep"
        - "5000"
    ```




8. Inspect the two files under directory webapp-color-2. What command is run at container startup?
    Assume the image was created from the Dockerfile in this directory.
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod 
    metadata:
    name: webapp-green
    labels:
        name: webapp-green
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: simple-webapp
        image: kodekloud/webapp-color
        command: ["--color","green"]
    ```
