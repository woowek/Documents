1. We have deployed a POD. Inspect the POD and wait for it to start running.<br>
In the current(default) namespace.
    - 



2. The application stores logs at location /log/app.log. View the logs.<br>
You can exec in to the container and open the file:<br>
kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log
    - 



3. If the POD was to get deleted now, would you be able to view these logs.
    - NO


4. Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host.<br>
Use the spec provided below.
    - kubectl edit pod 로 다음 내용 적용    
    ```yaml
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: event-simulator
        image: kodekloud/event-simulator
        env:
        - name: LOG_HANDLERS
        value: file
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /log
        name: log-volume
    volumes:
    - name: log-volume
        hostPath:
        # directory location on host
        path: /var/log/webapp
        # this field is optional
        type: Directory
    ```


5. Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification.
    - kubernetes docs에 persistent volume 검색
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
    name: pv-log
    spec:
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
    capacity:
        storage: 100Mi
    hostPath:
        path: /pv/log
    ```




6. Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a Persistent Volume Claim with the given specification.
    - kubernetes docs에 persistent volume 검색
    ```yaml
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
    name: claim-log-1
    spec:
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
        requests:
        storage: 50Mi
    ```




7. What is the state of the Persistent Volume Claim?
    - kubectl get pvc 실행



8. What is the state of the Persistent Volume?
    - kubectl get pv 실행


9. Why is the claim not bound to the available Persistent Volume?
    - kubectl get pv,pvc 을 보면 ACCESS MODES 가 다르다.


10. Update the Access Mode on the claim to bind it to the PV.<br>
Delete and recreate the claim-log-1.
    - kubactl edit pvc 명령어로 다음과 같이 수정
    ```yaml
    spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
    ```


11. You requested for 50Mi, how much capacity is now available to the PVC?
    - kubectl get pvc 실행
    


12. Update the webapp pod to use the persistent volume claim as its storage.<br>
Replace hostPath configured earlier with the newly created PersistentVolumeClaim.

    ```yaml    
    volumes:
    - name: log-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: claim-log-1
    ```



13. What is the Reclaim Policy set on the Persistent Volume pv-log?
    - kubectl get pv


14. What would happen to the PV if the PVC was destroyed?
    - 


15. Try deleting the PVC and notice what happens.<br>
If the command hangs, you can use CTRL + C to get back to the bash prompt OR check the status of the pvc from another terminal
    - 



16. Why is the PVC stuck in Terminating state?



17. Let us now delete the webapp Pod.<br>
Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.




18. What is the state of the PVC now?



19. What is the state of the Persistent Volume now?
