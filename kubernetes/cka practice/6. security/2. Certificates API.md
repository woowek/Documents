1. A new member akshay joined our team. He requires access to our cluster. The Certificate Signing Request is at the /root location.<br>
Inspect it


2. Create a CertificateSigningRequest object with the name akshay with the contents of the akshay.csr file<br>
As of kubernetes 1.19, the API to use for CSR is certificates.k8s.io/v1.<br>
Please note that an additional field called signerName should also be added when creating CSR. For client authentication to the API server we will use the built-in signer kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client.
    - cat akshay.csr | base64 -w 0 로 키를 확인 후
    - kubernetes docs 에서 certicicate request를 참고하여 yaml 형태를 적용한다. (Create a CertificateSigningRequest 항목)
    - 아래 내용으로 yaml을 저장한다.
    ```
    apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CertificateSigningRequest
    metadata:
        name: akshay
    spec:
        groups:

        usages:
        - client auth
    ```
    - kubectl apply -f aks.yaml 로 등록


3. What is the Condition of the newly created Certificate Signing Request object?
    - kubectl get csr 명령어 실행


4. Approve the CSR Request
    - kubectl certificate approve akshay 실행


5. How many CSR requests are available on the cluster?<br>
Including approved and pending
    - kubectl get csr 명령어 실행


6. During a routine check you realized that there is a new CSR request in place. What is the name of this request?
    - kubectl get csr 명령어 실행


7. Hmmm.. You are not aware of a request coming in. What groups is this CSR requesting access to?<br>
Check the details about the request. Preferably in YAML.
    - kubectl get csr agent-smith -o yaml 실행 후 groups: 확인


8. That doesn't look very right. Reject that request.
    - kubectl certificate deny agent-smith 실행



9. Let's get rid of it. Delete the new CSR object
    - kubectl delete csr agent-smith 실행
